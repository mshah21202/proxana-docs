## How Proxana works

To use Proxana you first create and configure your proxy to target the service you want to securely use, then add your API key through our dashboard.

We encrypt your API key and store it securely, so it can be used to authenticate requests to the service.

You can then use the Proxana proxy URL in your application in place of the original service URL. Proxana will automatically inject your API key into the requests, allowing you to securely access the service without exposing your API key in your frontend code.
